## Description:

- Search Employee is a react app that allows a user to search an "employee database" and sort the table based on column headers. The search utlizes the randomuser api and will be called each time the page loads as no real database is connected. During development, it was more fun to try and search the database to see what employees the api generated and to see where they were from, rather than having a set list from a database.
